### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I am Sabian Muhammad also known as The Uberhuman. I am an oral deaf - I Can't hear but can speak very well, so well that I've made a side career as a public speaker. I am a developer in learning with an interest in creating code that will benefit deaf communities of today and the future.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science with CoGrammar and HyperionDev through their 16 week skills bootcamp. This includes learning python, data analysis and statistics. I'd like to get into machine learning however, my mathematical skills are lacking at the moment. So let's see where I am in 14 weeks' time.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improving my algebraic aptitude and strengthening my coding skills on python.
